# MineSweeper
 A simple text-based version of the famous Minesweeper game.

## Quick Information
This project was designed to be started and finished in about a week. I wanted the code to be organized in multiple files in order to prevent a single file from becoming too difficult to understand. The program was written in C++ and does not need any installs other than the core .cpp & .h files.

## Example of how to run
Find the directory where the game is located using cd. Once in the directory, follow the following example using all of the .cpp files. You do not need to use g++ specifically and can name the file anyway you like.
ex: "g++ MineSweeper.cpp BorderLogic.cpp GameBoard.cpp Menu.cpp SaveAndLoad.cpp UserInput.cpp -o MineSweeperRun"

## Open to suggestions
I am determined to improve in any way I can. Any suggestions or tips are welcome.

## Objectives used when working
-Ability to select from predetermined difficulties and fail conditions
-Flexible Save & Load Feature -> which can be used on future project with minimal changes
-Write reusable & easy to read/edit code & functions
-Limit functions to one job, keep small and keep emphasis on being easy to understand
-Code is separated into multiple files for readability
-Leave comments throughout to assist in understanding code but not too many to be overwhelming
